Hey there 👋

I'm Fermín, a Freelance Software Developer working from La Paloma, Uruguay 🏖️

Most of my experience is in web development working on both simple projects like landing pages and complex ones like e-commerce sites, blogs, etc. I’ve worked both alone and with teams for different companies, and I have plenty of experience working remotely.

If you have a project you think I can help you with don't hesitate to tell me about it at fermin@ares.uy 👨‍💻

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - 🚌 [BusesUY](https://buses.uy/): A search engine for medium & long distance bus lines in Uruguay.
  - 🌳 [Arbolado Urbano](https://github.com/suberek/arboles): An interactive web tool for exploring data gather from different census about city trees.
  - 🧻 [Papelapp](https://papelapp.ares.uy): An app for figuring out the cost per meter of toilet paper rolls.
  - 👂 [Écouter](https://github.com/ferares/ecouter): A web site for language teachers and students to access the accompanying audio tracks from their text books with ease.
  - 📸 [Postales](https://github.com/ferares/random-pictures): A collaborative API for uploading and then accessing photos of sceneries tagged with their corresponding locations and photographers. 

 - 🌱 I’m currently learning:
   - :accessibility: Web Accessibility: Been learning for a while and I'm currently starting to work with it on real life projects.
   - 🦀 Rust: Just wanting to know what all the fuzz is about, looking to rewrite my "Postales" project using it.
